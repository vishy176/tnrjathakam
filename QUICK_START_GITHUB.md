## What You Need to Do (15 Minutes)

### 1️⃣ Create GitHub Account (if you don't have one)
Go to: **https://github.com/signup**

### 2️⃣ Use Your Existing Repository
You already have a repository called **"tnrjathakam"** on GitHub - we'll use that!

Skip this step since your repository already exists.

### 3️⃣ Upload Your Code

Open Terminal and run these commands **ONE BY ONE**:

```bash
# Navigate to your project folder
cd jathakam-app

git init

git add .

git commit -m "Initial commit"

git branch -M main

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/tnrjathakam.git

git push -u origin main
```

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username!

**Example:** If your username is "rajesh123", the command would be:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/rajesh123/tnrjathakam.git
```

### 4️⃣ Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **"Settings"** tab
3. Click **"Pages"** in left sidebar
4. Under "Build and deployment", select **"GitHub Actions"**
5. Done!

### 5️⃣ Wait for Deployment

1. Click **"Actions"** tab in your repository
2. You'll see "Deploy to GitHub Pages" running
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for green checkmark ✓

### 6️⃣ Access Your App! 🎉

Your app will be at:
```
https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/tnrjathakam/
```

---

## ✅ After Deployment

### Use on Your Phone:
1. Open the URL in mobile browser
2. **Add to Home Screen**:
   - Android: Menu (⋮) → "Add to Home Screen"
   - iPhone: Share (📤) → "Add to Home Screen"
3. Use like a native app!

### Update Your App Later:
Whenever you make changes:
```bash
cd jathakam-app
git add .
git commit -m "Updated app"
git push
```
GitHub will automatically rebuild and deploy in 2-3 minutes!

**Common Issues:**
